SWordy 0.1 beta
===============

If you want to use the local SWordy HTTPS server you need Node.js 
(https://nodejs.org) and npm (https://www.npmjs.com/) be installed into 
your system. Install them and then enter the "server" folder (which is 
under the swordy main folder) and install all the dependencies which are 
required by the SWordy HTTPS server by typing:

npm install

Finally, start the web server by typing:

npm start

The server will listen to https://localhost:8088

If you want to test if the server is running correctly, visit the 
following web page:

https://localhost:8088/test
